This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Functionality Given In the Challenge
All the functionalities have been implemented and are working well be it the search functionality or infinite scrolling.
The details page of the app is fully SSR rendered.
The app is fully responsive.

## What would I do if had been given some more time
As I have not used testing libraby before in my work or side projects I couldnt implement it.
If had been a day extra or two I would try to learn testing and implement it.
